# 🔁 Repeat Extension plugin

NotePlan has a simple [built-in repeat mechanism](https://noteplan.co/faq/Notes%20&%20Todos/How%20to%20create%20a%20recurring%20or%20repeating%20todo/), which allows for `@repeat(1/n)`.  That wasn't flexible enough for my purposes, so I created my own extension to this mechanism.

This plugin allows repeats **every x days, weeks, months, quarters or years**. It does the work of creating the next task using information from completed tasks that include a `@repeat(interval)`, on the appropriate future date.  For example when this task:
```
* [ ] put out recycling bin @repeat(2w)
```
is completed, and then `/rpt` run, the task then becomes:
```
* [x] put out recycling bin @repeat(2w) @done(2021-07-01)
* [ ] put out recycling bin @repeat(2w) >2021-07-15
```
and the task will show up again 2 weeks later. 

## Running it
It runs on the _currently open note_, by typing `/generate repeats` (or its alias `/rpt`) in the command bar.  
- When run on a _Project note_, it creates the new repeated task straight after the completed task.
- When run on a (daily or weekly) _Calendar note_, it creates the new repeated task on the date of the new repeat.

There is no automatic way to trigger plugins in NotePlan at the moment, so it needs to be run each time one of these `@repeat(interval)` tasks is completed.

## Specifiying the Intervals
The time intervals have two parts: number and then a character. The **character** is one of:
- `b`: business days (ignore weekends, but doesn't ignore public holidays, as they're different for each country.)
- `d`: days
- `w`: weeks
- `m`: months
- `q`: quarters
- `y`: years.

When the **number** starts with a **+** (e.g. `+1m`) it will duplicate the task for 1 month after the date the _task was completed_.
When the number doesn't start with a + (e.g. `1m`) it will duplicate the task for 1 month after the date the _task was last due_. This is found from a `>yyyy-mm-dd` scheduled date. If this can't be determined, then it defaults to the first option.

## Configuration
For this feature to work, you need to have the '**Append Completion Date**' NotePlan setting turned on in the Preferences (and not to mind the time portion of the `@done(...)` tag being removed, as a sign that the line has been processed).

## Support
If you find an issue with this plugin, or would like to suggest new features for it, please raise a [Bug or Feature 'Issue'](https://github.com/NotePlan/plugins/issues).
