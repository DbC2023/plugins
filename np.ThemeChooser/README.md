## Overview
This plugin is designed to make switching themes fast and easy without having to open the NotePlan Preferences Panel.

You can switch to any theme at any time using the command:
`/Choose Theme`

And you can set five preset themes to be listed in your CMD-J Command Bar for quick access using the command:
`/Change Theme Preset`

After you set them as presets, switching to that theme will be its own plugin command (one step), e.g.:
`/toothbleach`
or
`/dracula-pro`

This will also list the presets you choose in your NotePlan > Plugins menu bar, so you can assign your own keyboard shortcut using Keyboard Maestro or Apple's Keyboard System Settings.

```
NOTE: When you set one of the 5 presets using the `/Change Theme Preset` command, the theme is
immediately available to you in the Command Bar. However, because NotePlan only generates the 
menu bar items once (at start-up), you will not see them in the menu bar until you restart
NotePlan.
```

Use `/Change Theme Preset` again to change any preset you already set to another theme instead.

## Toggling Themes
If you tend to go back/forth between light and dark themes and want a quick way to toggle, run the command:
`Toggle Light/Dark`

If you haven't set up your defaults, the plugin will prompt you to do so when you run the `Toggle Light/Dark` command.

You can change or set you light/dark theme using the command:
`Set Toggleable Light/Dark Theme (for this device)`

```
NOTE: As you can see from the name, Light/Dark theme settings are set on a per-device basis, 
so your Mac will have one set and your iPhone will have another (this is by design). 
You will need to set the defaults on each device.
```
