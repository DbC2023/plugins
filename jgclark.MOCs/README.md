# ðŸ•¸ Maps of Content plugin

This will be particularly of interest to Zettelkasten/PKM fans, who are used to the idea of 'Maps of Content' (MOC) to be a contents page into a topic.
This has a single command (/make MOC) that runs iteratively, asking the user for search term(s) to look for across all notes. It then creates (or updates) the specified note, inserting `[[note links]]` to all notes it finds with those search term(s).  These are inserted in order of most to least recently updated.

_This is a first release, and feedback is very welcome._

## Configuration
Click the gear button on the 'MOCs' line in the Plugin Preferences panel to configure this plugin. Each setting has an explanation.
