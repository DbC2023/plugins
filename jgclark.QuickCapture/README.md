# ‚ö°Ô∏è QuickCapture plugin
This plugin provides commands to more quickly add tasks/todos or general text to NotePlan notes, _without having to switch away from the note you're currently working on_:

- **/quick add task to inbox** (alias **/int**): Quickly add a task to your chosen Inbox location. (To configure this, see below.)
- **/quick add task under heading** (alias **/qath**): Quickly add a task at the top of a chosen note's heading
- **/quick add line under heading** (alias **/qalh**): Quickly add text lines at the top of a chosen note's heading
- **/quick add to daily note** (alias **/qad**): Quickly add a task to a chosen daily note
- **/quick add to weekly note** (alias **/qaw**): Quickly add a task to a chosen weekly note
- **/quick add to journal today** (alias **/qaj**): Quickly add text to the Journal section of today's daily note
- **/quick add task to note** (alias **/qat**): Quickly append a task to a chosen project note
- **/quick prepend task to daily note** (alias **/qpd**): Quickly prepend a task to a chosen daily note
- **/quick prepend task to note** (alias **/qpt**): Quickly prepend a task to a chosen project note. (Inserts after title or YAML frontmatter, or starting metadata lines.)

**Tip for macOS users**: add Keyboard Shortcuts to get to these commands even more quickly.


## Configuration
The command `/quick add task to inbox` requires configuring, by clicking on the gear button on the 'Event Helpers' line in the Plugin Preferences panel.

The settings are:
- **Where is your Inbox?**: Select 'Daily' or 'Weekly' to use whatever is the current daily or weekly note. Or  choose 'Fixed' and then add the note title in the next setting
- **InboxTitle**: If the previous setting is set to 'Fixed', this is wherre you set the Title of that note. (Default: "üì• Inbox".)
-	**Where to add in Inbox?**: either "prepend" (start) or "append" (end) in Inbox (and the other commands which use the term 'add')
- **Text to append to new inbox tasks**: optional text  (that can include hashtags or mentions) to append to any tasks captured to the inbox.

## Using from x-callback calls
From v0.9 it's possible to call each of these commands from [outside NotePlan using the **x-callback mechanism**](https://help.noteplan.co/article/49-x-callback-url-scheme#runplugin). The URL calls all take the same form:
```
noteplan://x-callback-url/runPlugin?pluginID=jgclark.QuickCapture&command=<encoded command name>&arg0=<encoded string>&arg1=<encoded string>&arg2=<encoded string>
```
Notes:
- the number and order of arguments you pass is important
- where an argument isn't valid (empty in the table below), don't include it
- as with all x-callback URLs, all the arguments (including the command name) need to be URL encoded. For example, spaces need to be turned into '%20'.
- The matching of section headings in /qalh and /qath is done as an exact match, or (from v0.12) just the first part of it. This means it's possible to have a section such as `## Journal for 3.4.22` that changes every day, but still refer to it by the unchanging string `Journal`.
- from NotePlan v3.6.1 and plugin v0.12.0 it's possible to send one or more empty arguments, and that will cause the missing argument(s) be requested from the user, as it it were run interactively.

<!--??? hopefully in time /qad adds yesterday, today, tomorrow terms -->
<!--??? hopefully in time /qaw adds thisweek, nextweek terms -->
